# go-ipfs-docker-examples

Now that we have [landed](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6577) a way to
set and manage config in containers started from the go-ipfs [Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/go-ipfs/), it opens up some nice
possibilities.

Some of these examples will be immediately usable, some are starting points,
each has its own README.
